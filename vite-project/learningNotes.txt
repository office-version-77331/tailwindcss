In your updated code, the reason the grandchild (<a> tags inside <li>) is being affected by the flex class is because of the Tailwind CSS grouping selector feature ([&>*]:flex).

What Does [&>*]:flex Mean?
The [&>*] syntax is a Tailwind arbitrary selector. It applies the styles (flex in this case) to all direct children of the element it is applied to. Here's the breakdown:

&: Refers to the current element (in this case, the <ul>).
>: Targets only direct children of the current element (<li>).
*: Matches all child elements (in this case, the <li>).
:flex: Applies the flex class to those direct children.
So, in your code:

html

Edit
<ul className="bg-black flex [&>*]:flex">
The flex class directly applies to the <ul>, making its direct children (<li>) align in a row.
The [&>*]:flex applies the flex class to all direct children of <ul>, which are the <li> elements. This forces the <li> elements to become flex containers themselves, allowing their children (<a> tags) to behave as flex items.
Why Does It Affect the Grandchild?
Since [&>*]:flex makes <li> a flex container, the <a> tags inside <li> become flex items. As a result:

The <a> tag inherits flexbox behavior.
If additional flex properties (e.g., justify-center, items-center) are added to <li>, they will affect the <a> tags' positioning and layout.
Visual Explanation of the Flow:
ul:
The flex class aligns its <li> children in a row.
li (Direct Children):
[&>*]:flex makes each <li> a flex container.
a (Grandchild):
Since <li> is a flex container, the <a> inside behaves as a flex item.
Example Without [&>*]:flex:
If you remove [&>*]:flex, the <li> elements won't behave as flex containers, and the <a> tags inside will revert to their default block behavior.

html

<ul className="bg-black flex">
  <li><a className="p-3 text-white bg-black" href="">Home</a></li>
  <li><a className="p-3 text-white bg-black" href="">Home</a></li>
</ul>
Key Use Case for [&>*]:flex:
This syntax is particularly helpful when you want to style children consistently without adding classes individually to each child.
